"""You've good eyes,"" said Whitney, with a laugh,"" and I've seen you pick off a moose moving in the brown fall bush at four hundred yards, but even you can't see four miles or so through a moonless Caribbean night."" ""Nor four yards,"" admitted Rainsford. ""Ugh! It's like moist black velvet."" ""It will be light enough in Rio,"" promised Whitney. ""We should make it in a few days. I hope the jaguar guns have come from Purdey's. We should have some good hunting up the Amazon. Great sport, hunting."" ""The best sport in the world,"" agreed Rainsford. ""For the hunter,"" amended Whitney. ""Not for the jaguar."" ""Don't talk rot, Whitney,"" said Rainsford. ""You're a big-game hunter, not a philosopher. Who cares how a jaguar feels?"" ""Perhaps the jaguar does,"" observed Whitney. ""Bah! They've no understanding.""",0
"""Nonsense,"" laughed Rainsford. ""This hot weather is making you soft, Whitney. Be a realist. The world is made up of two classes--the hunters and the huntees. Luckily, you and I are hunters. Do you think we've passed that island yet?"" ""I can't tell in the dark. I hope so."" ""Why? "" asked Rainsford. ""The place has a reputation--a bad one."" ""Cannibals?"" suggested Rainsford. ""Hardly. Even cannibals wouldn't live in such a God-forsaken place. But it's gotten into sailor lore, somehow. Didn't you notice that the crew's nerves seemed a bit jumpy today?""",0
"""Yes, even that tough-minded old Swede, who'd go up to the devil himself and ask him for a light. Those fishy blue eyes held a look I never saw there before. All I could get out of him was `This place has an evil name among seafaring men, sir.' Then he said to me, very gravely, `Don't you feel anything?'--as if the air about us was actually poisonous. Now, you mustn't laugh when I tell you this--I did feel something like a sudden chill. ""There was no breeze. The sea was as flat as a plate-glass window. We were drawing near the island then. What I felt was a--a mental chill; a sort of sudden dread."" ""Pure imagination,"" said Rainsford. ""One superstitious sailor can taint the whole ship's company with his fear."" ""Maybe. But sometimes I think sailors have an extra sense that tells them when they are in danger. Sometimes I think evil is a tangible thing--with wave lengths, just as sound and light have. An evil place can, so to speak, broadcast vibrations of evil. Anyhow, I'm glad we're getting out of this zone. Well, I think I'll turn in now, Rainsford."" ""I'm not sleepy,"" said Rainsford.",0
"He struggled up to the surface and tried to cry out, but the wash from the speeding yacht slapped him in the face and the salt water in his open mouth made him gag and strangle. Desperately he struck out with strong strokes after the receding lights of the yacht, but he stopped before he had swum fifty feet. A certain coolheadedness had come to him; it was not the first time he had been in a tight place. There was a chance that his cries could be heard by someone aboard the yacht, but that chance was slender and grew more slender as the yacht raced on. He wrestled himself out of his clothes and shouted with all his power. The lights of the yacht became faint and ever-vanishing fireflies; then they were blotted out entirely by the night.",0
"Where there are pistol shots, there are men. Where there are men, there is food,"" he thought. But what kind of men, he wondered, in so forbidding a place? An unbroken front of snarled and ragged jungle fringed the shore. He saw no sign of a trail through the closely knit web of weeds and trees; it was easier to go along the shore, and Rainsford floundered along by the water. Not far from where he landed, he stopped. Some wounded thing--by the evidence, a large animal--had thrashed about in the underbrush; the jungle weeds were crushed down and the moss was lacerated; one patch of weeds was stained crimson. A small, glittering object not far away caught Rainsford's eye and he picked it up. It was an empty cartridge.",0
"When we arrived in New York City, our names changed almost immediately. At Immigration, the officer asked my father, Mister Elbures, if he had anything to declare. My father shook his head no, and we were waved through. I was too afraid we wouldn’t be let in if I corrected the man’s punctuation, but I said our name to myself, opening my mouth wide for the organ blast of a. trilling my tongue for the drumroll of the r, All-vabrrr-es! How could anyone get Elbures out of that orchestra of sound?",0
"We moved into our new apartment building, the super called my father Mister Alberase, and the neighbors who became mother’s friends pronounced her name Jewlee-ah instead of Hoo-lee-ah. I, her namesake, was known as Hoo-lee-tah at home. But at school I was Judy or Judith, and once an English teacher mistook me for Juliet. It took me a while to get used to my new names. I wondered if I shouldn’t correct my teachers and new friends. But my mother argued that it didn’t matter. “You know what your friend Shakespeare said, ‘A rose by any other name would smell as sweet’.” My family had gotten into the habit of calling any famous author “my friend” because I had begun to write poems and stories in English class.",0
"By the time I was in high school, I was a popular kid, and it showed in my name. Friends called me Jules or Hey Jude, and once a group of troublemaking friends my mother forbade me to hang out with called me Alcatraz. I was Hoo-lee-tah only to Mami and Papi and uncles and aunts who came over to eat sancocho on Sunday afternoons old world folk whom I would just as soon go back to where they came from and leave me to pursue whatever mischief I wanted to in America. JUDY ALCATRAZ, the name on the “Wanted” poster would read. Who would ever trace her to me?",0
"My older sister had the hardest time getting an American name for herself because Mauricia did not translate into English. Ironically, although she had the most foreign-sounding name, she and I were the Americans in the family. We had been born in New York City when our parents had first tried immigration and then gone back “home,” too homesick to stay. My mother often told the story of how she had almost changed my sister’s name in the hospital. After the delivery, Mami and some other new mothers were cooing over their new baby sons and daughters and exchanging names and weights and delivery stories. My mother was embarrassed among the Sallys and Janes and Georges and Johns to reveal the rich, noisy name of Mauricia, so when her turn came to brag, she gave her baby’s name as Maureen.",0
"My mother blushed and admitted her baby’s real name to the group. Her motherin-law had recently died, she apologized, and her husband had insisted that the first daughter be named after his mother, Mauran. My mother thought it the ugliest name she had ever heard, and she talked my father into what she believed was an improvement, a combination of Mauran and her own mother’s name, Felicia.",0
"He heard a harsh laugh behind him, and turning round saw the old King looking at him with a malicious expression. ""Well, my friend! You don't seem to have managed so wonderfully with your first two wishes, do you? What will you do with the last? Turn yourself into a swan? Or turn Leita back into a girl?""",0
"I shall do neither,"" said Mr. Peters calmly. ""Human beings and swans are better in their own shapes."" But for all that he looked sadly over towards the forest where Leita had flown, and walked slowly back to his empty house. Next day he saw two swans swimming at the bottom of the garden, and one of them wore the gold chain he had given Leita after their marriage; she came up and rubbed her head against his hand.",0
Mr. Peters and his two swans came to be well known in that part of the country; people used to say that he talked to the swans and they understood him as well as his neighbors. Many people were a little frightened of him. There was a story that once when thieves tried to break into his house they were set upon by two huge white birds which carried them off bodily and dropped them in the river,0
"As Mr. Peters grew old everyone wondered at his contentment. Even when he was bent with rheumatism he would not think of moving to a drier spot, but went slowly about his work, milking the cows and collecting the honey and eggs, with the two swans always somewhere close at hand. Sometimes people who knew his story would say to him: ""Mr. Peters, why don't you wish for another wife?""",0
"""Not likely,"" he would answer serenely. ""Two wishes were enough for me, I reckon. I've learned that even if your wishes are granted they don't always better you. I'll stay faithful to Leita."" One autumn night, passers-by along the road heard the mournful sound of two swans singing. All night the song went on, sweet and harsh, sharp and clear. In the morning Mr. Peters was found peacefully dead in his bed with a smile of great happiness on his face. In between his hands, which lay clasped on his breast, were a withered leaf and a white feather.",0
"Mr. Peters caught the leaves and put two of them carefully in his notecase. When he looked up the swan was sailing about in the middle of the water again, flicking the drops angrily down its long neck. Mr. Peters stood for some minutes reflecting on how he should use his reward. He knew very well that the gift of three magic wishes was one which brought trouble more often than not, and he had no intention of being like the forester who first wished by mistake for a sausage, and then in a rage wished it on the end of his wife's nose, and then had to use his last wish in getting it off again.",0
"A tremendous quacking and splashing broke out on the surface of the water. He thought that it was the swan laughing at him. Taking no notice he made his way through the darkening woods to his car, wrapped himself up in the rug and went to sleep. When",0
"""Yes I am,"" she replied. ""My name is Leita."" She stepped into the car beside him and they drove off to the church on the outskirts of the forest, where they were married. Then he took her to his house in a remote and lovely valley and showed her all his treasures-the bees in their white hives, the Jersey cows, the hyacinths, the silver candlesticks, the blue cups and the lustre bowl for putting primroses in. She admired everything, but what pleased her most was the river which ran by the foot of his garden.",0
"Leita made him a good wife. She was gentle and friendly, busied herself about the house garden, polished the bowls, milked the cows and mended his socks. But as time went by Mr. Peters began to feel that she was not happy. She seemed restless, wandered much in the garden, and sometimes when he came back from the fields he would find the house empty and she would only return after half an hour or so with no explanation of where she had been. On these occasions she was always especially tender and would put out his slippers to warm and cook his favorite dish-Welsh rarebit with wild strawberries-for supper.",0
"One night when he had been late doing the accounts he came up to bed and found her weeping in her sleep and calling: ""Rhea! Rhea! I can't understand what you say! Oh, wait for me, take me with you!"" Then he knew that it was hopeless and she would never be happy as a human. He stooped down and kissed her goodbye, then took another leaf from his notecase, blew it out of the window, and used up his second wish.",0
The uncle thought it a good joke.,0
"""You keep twenty pounds in reserve, do you, you young romancer? What are you betting, then?""",0
"""I'm betting three hundred,"" said the boy gravely. ""But it's between you and me, Uncle Oscar! Honour bright?""",0
"""It's between you and me all right, you young Nat Gould,"" he said, laughing. ""But where's your three hundred?""",0
"""Bassett keeps it for me. We're partners.""",0
"""You are, are you! And what is Bassett putting on Daffodil?""",0
"""He won't go quite as high as I do, I expect. Perhaps he'll go a hundred and fifty.""",0
"""What, pennies?"" laughed the uncle.",0
"""Pounds,"" said the child, with a surprised look at his uncle. ""Bassett keeps a bigger reserve than I do.""",0
"Between wonder and amusement Uncle Oscar was silent. He pursued the matter no further, but he determined to take his nephew with him to the Lincoln races.",0
"""Now, son,"" he said, ""I'm putting twenty on Mirza, and I'll put five on for you on any horse you fancy. What's your pick?""",0
"""Daffodil, uncle.""",0
"""No, not the fiver on Daffodil!""",0
"""I should if it was my own fiver,"" said the child.",0
"""Good! Good! Right you are! A fiver for me and a fiver for you on Daffodil.""",0
"The child had never been to a race-meeting before, and his eyes were blue fire. He pursed his mouth tight and watched. A Frenchman just in front had put his money on Lancelot. Wild with excitement, he flayed his arms up and down, yelling ""Lancelot!, Lancelot!"" in his French accent.",0
"Daffodil came in first, Lancelot second, Mirza third. The child, flushed and with eyes blazing, was curiously serene. His uncle brought him four five-pound notes, four to one.",0
"""What am I to do with these?"" he cried, waving them before the boys eyes.",0
"""I suppose we'll talk to Bassett,"" said the boy. ""I expect I have fifteen hundred now; and twenty in reserve; and this twenty.""",0
His uncle studied him for some moments.,0
"""Look here, son!"" he said. ""You're not serious about Bassett and that fifteen hundred, are you?""",0
"""Yes, I am. But it's between you and me, uncle. Honour bright?""",0
"""Honour bright all right, son! But I must talk to Bassett.""",0
"""If you'd like to be a partner, uncle, with Bassett and me, we could all be partners. Only, you'd have to promise, honour bright, uncle, not to let it go beyond us three. Bassett and I are lucky, and you must be lucky, because it was your ten shillings I started winning with ...""",0
"Uncle Oscar took both Bassett and Paul into Richmond Park for an afternoon, and there they talked.",0
"""It's like this, you see, sir,"" Bassett said. ""Master Paul would get me talking about racing events, spinning yarns, you know, sir. And he was always keen on knowing if I'd made or if I'd lost. It's about a year since, now, that I put five shillings on Blush of Dawn for him: and we lost. Then the luck turned, with that ten shillings he had from you: that we put on Singhalese. And since that time, it's been pretty steady, all things considering. What do you say, Master Paul?""",0
"""We're all right when we're sure,"" said Paul. ""It's when we're not quite sure that we go down.""",0
"""Oh, but we're careful then,"" said Bassett.",0
"""But when are you sure?"" smiled Uncle Oscar.",0
"""It's Master Paul, sir,"" said Bassett in a secret, religious voice. ""It's as if he had it from heaven. Like Daffodil, now, for the Lincoln. That was as sure as eggs.""",0
"""Did you put anything on Daffodil?"" asked Oscar Cresswell.",0
"""I keep it safe locked up, sir. Master Paul he can have it any minute he likes to ask for it.""",0
"""What, fifteen hundred pounds?""",0
"""And twenty! And forty, that is, with the twenty he made on the course.""",0
"""It's amazing!"" said the uncle.",0
"""If Master Paul offers you to be partners, sir, I would, if I were you: if you'll excuse me,"" said Bassett.",0
Oscar Cresswell thought about it.,0
"""I'll see the money,"" he said.",0
"They drove home again, and, sure enough, Bassett came round to the garden-house with fifteen hundred pounds in notes. The twenty pounds reserve was left with Joe Glee, in the Turf Commission deposit.",0
"""You see, it's all right, uncle, when I'm sure! Then we go strong, for all we're worth, don't we, Bassett?""",0
"""We do that, Master Paul.""",0
"""And when are you sure?"" said the uncle, laughing.",0
"""Oh, well, sometimes I'm absolutely sure, like about Daffodil,"" said the boy; ""and sometimes I have an idea; and sometimes I haven't even an idea, have I, Bassett? Then we're careful, because we mostly go down.""",0
"""You do, do you! And when you're sure, like about Daffodil, what makes you sure, sonny?""",0
"""Oh, well, I don't know,"" said the boy uneasily. ""I'm sure, you know, uncle; that's all.""",0
"""It's as if he had it from heaven, sir,"" Bassett reiterated.",0
"""I should say so!"" said the uncle.",0
"But he became a partner. And when the Leger was coming on Paul was 'sure' about Lively Spark, which was a quite inconsiderable horse. The boy insisted on putting a thousand on the horse, Bassett went for five hundred, and Oscar Cresswell two hundred. Lively Spark came in first, and the betting had been ten to one against him. Paul had made ten thousand.",0
"‘O God,’ he thought, ‘what a demanding job I’ve chosen! Day in, day out on the road. The stresses of trade are much greater than the work going on at head office, and, in addition to that, I have to deal with the problems of traveling, the worries about train connections, irregular bad food, temporary and constantly changing human relationships which never come from the heart. To hell with it all!’ He felt a slight itching on the top of his abdomen. He slowly pushed himself on his back closer to the bed post so that he could lift his head more easily, found the itchy part, which was entirely covered with small white spots",0
"And he looked over at the alarm clock ticking away by the chest of drawers. ‘Good God,’ he thought. It was half The Metamorphosis 6 of 96 past six, and the hands were going quietly on. It was past the half hour, already nearly quarter to. Could the alarm have failed to ring? One saw from the bed that it was properly set for four o’clock. Certainly it had rung. Yes, but was it possible to sleep through this noise that made the furniture shake? Now, it’s true he’d not slept quietly, but evidently he’d slept all the more deeply. Still, what should he do now?",0
"At last the mother said: ""I will see if I can't make something."" But she did not know where to begin. She racked her brains, and tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything successful. The failure made deep lines come into her face. Her children were growing up, they would have to go to school. There must be more money, there must be more money. The father, who was always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he never would be able to do anything worth doing. And the mother, who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and her tastes were just as expensive.",0
"And so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase: There must be more money! There must be more money! The children could hear it all the time though nobody said it aloud. They heard it at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the nursery. Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart doll's house, a voice would start whispering: ""There must be more money! There must be more money!"" And the children would stop playing, to listen for a moment. They would look into each other's eyes, to see if they had all heard. And each one saw in the eyes of the other two that they too had heard. ""There must be more money! There must be more money!""",0
"Yet nobody ever said it aloud. The whisper was everywhere, and therefore no one spoke it. Just as no one ever says: ""We are breathing!"" in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going all the time.",0
"""Mother,"" said the boy Paul one day, ""why don't we keep a car of our own? Why do we always use uncle's, or else a taxi?""",0
"""Because we're the poor members of the family,"" said the mother.",0
"""But why are we, mother?""",0
"""Well - I suppose,"" she said slowly and bitterly, ""it's because your father has no luck.""",0
The boy was silent for some time.,0
"""Is luck money, mother?"" he asked, rather timidly.",0
"""No, Paul. Not quite. It's what causes you to have money.""",0
"""Oh!"" said Paul vaguely. ""I thought when Uncle Oscar said filthy lucker, it meant money.""",0
"""Filthy lucre does mean money,"" said the mother. ""But it's lucre, not luck.""",0
"""Oh!"" said the boy. ""Then what is luck, mother?""",0
"""It's what causes you to have money. If you're lucky you have money. That's why it's better to be born lucky than rich. If you're rich, you may lose your money. But if you're lucky, you will always get more money.""",0
"""Oh! Will you? And is father not lucky?""",0
"""Very unlucky, I should say,"" she said bitterly.",0

"""Don't they? Nobody at all? Does nobody know?""",0
"""Perhaps God. But He never tells.""",0

"""I can't be, it I married an unlucky husband.""",0
"""But by yourself, aren't you?""",0
"""I used to think I was, before I married. Now I think I am very unlucky indeed.""",0
"""Why?""",0
"""Well - never mind! Perhaps I'm not really,"" she said.",0
"The child looked at her to see if she meant it. But he saw, by the lines of her mouth, that she was only trying to hide something from him.",0
"""Well, anyhow,"" he said stoutly, ""I'm a lucky person.""",0
"""Why?"" said his mother, with a sudden laugh.",0
He stared at her. He didn't even know why he had said it.,0

"""He's always riding like that! I wish he'd leave off!"" said his elder sister Joan.",0
"But he only glared down on them in silence. Nurse gave him up. She could make nothing of him. Anyhow, he was growing beyond her.",0
One day his mother and his Uncle Oscar came in when he was on one of his furious rides. He did not speak to them.,0
"""Hallo, you young jockey! Riding a winner?"" said his uncle.",0
"""Aren't you growing too big for a rocking-horse? You're not a very little boy any longer, you know,"" said his mother.",0
"But Paul only gave a blue glare from his big, rather close-set eyes. He would speak to nobody when he was in full tilt. His mother watched him with an anxious expression on her face.",0
At last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical gallop and slid down.,0
"""Well, I got there!"" he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still flaring, and his sturdy long legs straddling apart.",0
"""Where did you get to?"" asked his mother.",0
"""Where I wanted to go,"" he flared back at her.",0
"""That's right, son!"" said Uncle Oscar. ""Don't you stop till you get there. What's the horse's name?""",0
"""He doesn't have a name,"" said the boy.",0
"Well, he has different names. He was called Sansovino last week.""",0
"""Sansovino, eh? Won the Ascot. How did you know this name?""",0
"""He always talks about horse-races with Bassett,"" said Joan.",0
"The uncle was delighted to find that his small nephew was posted with all the racing news. Bassett, the young gardener, who had been wounded in the left foot in the war and had got his present job through Oscar Cresswell, whose batman he had been, was a perfect blade of the 'turf'. He lived in the racing events, and the small boy lived with him.",0
Oscar Cresswell got it all from Bassett.,0
"""Master Paul comes and asks me, so I can't do more than tell him, sir,"" said Bassett, his face terribly serious, as if he were speaking of religious matters.",0
"""And does he ever put anything on a horse he fancies?""",0

Bassett was serious as a church.,0
The uncle went back to his nephew and took him off for a ride in the car.,0
"""Say, Paul, old man, do you ever put anything on a horse?"" the uncle asked.",0
The boy watched the handsome man closely.,0
"""Why, do you think I oughtn't to?"" he parried.",0
"""Not a bit of it! I thought perhaps you might give me a tip for the Lincoln.""",0
"The car sped on into the country, going down to Uncle Oscar's place in Hampshire.",0

"""Honour bright, son!"" said the uncle.",0
"""Well, then, Daffodil.""",0
"""Daffodil! I doubt it, sonny. What about Mirza?""",0

"Once in a while the thought repeated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold. As he walked along he rubbed his face and nose with the back of his mittened hand. He did this without thinking, frequently changing hands. But, with all his rubbing, the instant he stopped, his face and nose became numb. His face would surely be frozen. He knew that and he was sorry that he had not worn the sort of nose guard Bud wore when it was cold.",0
"My oldest sister, Rosie, had won the jacket a few years back, and I fully expected to also. I was fourteen and in the eighth grade. I had been a straight A student since the first grade and this last year had looked forward very much to owning that jacket. My father was a farm laborer who couldn’t earn enough money to feed eight children, so when I was six I was given to my grandparents to raise",0
"I despaired every time I looked in the mirror. Pencil thin, not a curve anywhere. I was called “beanpole” and “string bean,” and I knew that’s what I looked like. A flat chest, no hips, and a brain; that’s what I had. That really wasn’t much for a fourteen-year-old to work with, I thought, as I absent-mindedly wandered from my history class to the gym. Another hour of sweating in basketball and displaying my toothpick legs was coming up. Then I remembered my P.E. shorts were still in a bag under my desk where I’d forgotten them. I had to walk all the way back and get them. Coach Thompson was a real bear if someone wasn’t dressed for P.E. She had said I was a good forward and even tried to talk Grandma into letting me join the team once. Of course Grandma said no",0
"Grandpa knew that I understood it was not a matter of money. It wasn’t that. He went back to hoeing the weeds that sprang up between the delicate little bean plants. It was a time-consuming job; sometimes the small shoots were right next to each other. Finally he spoke again as I turned to leave, crying. “Then if you pay for it, Marta, it’s not a scholarship jacket, is it? Tell your principal I will not pay the fifteen dollars.",0
"His face looked as happy and innocent as a baby’s, but I knew better. Without answering I gave him a quick hug and ran to the bus. I cried on the walk home again, but this time because I was so happy. I couldn’t wait to tell Grandpa and ran straight to the field. I joined him in the row where he was working, and without saying anything I crouched down and started pulling up the weeds with my hands. Grandpa worked alongside me for a few minutes, and he didn’t ask what had happened. After I had a little pile of weeds between the rows, I stood up and faced him. “The principal said he’s making an exception for me, Grandpa, and I’m getting the jacket after all. That’s after I told him what you said.” Grandpa didn’t say anything; he just gave me a pat on the shoulder and a smile. He pulled out the crumpled red handkerchief that he always carried in his back pocket and wiped the sweat off his forehead. “Better go see if your grandmother needs any help with supper.” I gave him a big grin. He didn’t fool me. I skipped and ran back to the house whistling some silly tune",0
"Segments like this are why Leave won. There was no attempt at logical, respectful discussion about the perfectly valid criticisms Leave has of the undemocratic way in which the EU operates, the lack of accountability in Brussels, and the lost of British national sovereignty.

"One morning less than a week before their bout, they met as usual for their daily workout. They fooled around with a few jabs at the air, slapped skin, and then took off, running lightly along the dirty East River’s edge. Antonio glanced at Felix, who kept his eyes purposely straight ahead, pausing from time to time to do some fancy leg work while throwing one-twos followed by uppercuts to an imaginary jaw. Antonio then beat the air with a barrage of body blows and short devastating lefts with an overhead jaw-breaking right. After a mile or so, Felix puffed and said, “Let’s stop a while, bro. I think we both got something to say to each other.”",0
"Felix leaned heavily on the river’s railing and stared across to the shores of Brooklyn. Finally, he broke the silence. “Man. I don’t know how to come out with it.” Antonio helped. “It’s about our fight, right?” “Yeah, right.” Felix’s eyes squinted at the rising orange sun. “I’ve been thinking about it too, panin.3 In fact, since we found out it was going to be me and you, I’ve been awake at night, pulling punches on you, trying not to hurt you.” “Same here. It ain’t natural not to think about the fight. I mean, we both are cheverote4 fighters and we both want to win",0
"Antonio nodded quietly. “Yeah. We both know that in the ring the better man wins. Friend or no friend, brother or no …” Felix finished it for him. “Brother. Tony, let’s promise something right here. OK?” “If it’s fair, hermano,5 I’m for it.” Antonio admired the courage of a tugboat pulling a barge five times its welter-weight size. “It’s fair, Tony. When we get into the ring, it’s gotta be like we never met. We gotta be like two heavy strangers that want the same thing and only one can have it. You understand, don’t cha?”",0
"The evening before the big fight, Tony made his way to the roof of his tenement. In the quiet early dark, he peered over the ledge. Six stories below, the lights of the city blinked and the sounds of cars mingled with the curses and the laughter of children in the street. He tried not to think of Felix, feeling he had succeeded in psyching his mind. But only in the ring would he really know. To spare Felix hurt, he would have to knock him out, early and quick",0
"Felix became the champ and Tony the challenger. The movie audience was going out of its head, roaring in blood lust at the butchery going on. The champ hunched his shoulders, grunting and sniffing red blood back into his broken nose. The challenger, confident that he had the championship in the bag, threw a left. The champ countered with a dynamite right that exploded into the challenger’s brains. Felix’s right arm felt the shock. Antonio’.",0
"""Well, we were gradually fading toward a better land, on account of the daily loss of sleep; so we finally had the expert up again, and he ran a wire to the outside of the door, and placed a switch there, whereby Thomas, the butler, always made one little mistake--he switched the alarm off at night when he went to bed, and switched it on again at daybreak in the morning, just in time for the cook to open the kitchen door, and enable that gong to slam us across the house, sometimes breaking a window with one or the other of us. At the end of a week we recognized that this switch business was a delusion and a snare.",0

Tomas agreed that this might be the case, so he and the unicorn walked down the mountain.The dragon, in case you are wondering, did not go with them. The dragon curled up and went back to sleep by the side of the pond.",0
"“Are you the same dragon?” asked Tomas.“Nope,” said the dragon. “That was my sister.” And then the dragon sniffed at the paper lunch bag. “I’m glad you brought enough graham crackers for all three of us.”They ate the lunch and fed the birds.Once they were done, Tomas asked the new tiny dragon if the chair on the top of the world was on top of thismountain.“Nope, sorry,” said the dragon. And, like its sister, the dragon said nothing more. Tomas sighed, “I guess I’ll never find the top of the world.”And then the dragon said something very curious. The dragon said, “The world is a marble.”",0

"""I do not go one single cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twain--not a single cent--and I will tell you why. When we were finishing our house, we found we had a little cash left over, on account of the plumber not knowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I was always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no, let's have a burglar alarm. I agreed to this compromise. I will explain that whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing, and we decide upon the thing that Mrs. McWilliams wants--as we always do --she calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New York and put in the alarm, and charged three hundred and twenty-five dollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now.",0
"It was even so. I redeemed the tinware at pawnbroker's rates, less cost of advertising, bade the burglar good-night, closed the window after him, and retired to headquarters to report. Next morning we sent for the burglar-alarm man, and he came up and explained that the reason the alarm did not 'go off' was that no part of the house but the first floor was attached to the alarm. This was simply idiotic; one might as well have no armor on at all in battle as to have it only on his legs. The expert now put the whole second story on the alarm, charged three hundred dollars for it, and went his way.",0

In solid fact, there is no clamor that is even remotely comparable to the dire clamor which that gong makes.",0
"It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture --a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees --very gradually --I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.",0
".I told her 'I'd like to get something that's going to flower or smell pretty,' and she looked at what seeds we could sow in February while I looked at birdfeeders and nuts. There was a long sparrow house the size of a rabbit hutch, some small boxes for tits and wasps, one open-faced for robins, wagtails and wrens. I liked the house and I like robins, so I took both, then the nuts and two kilos of seed for a birdfeeder I found with suckers on it to stick on a window.",0
"First thing we opened up the shed, let the door hang wide open, which made gardening a little more of an event, kind of challenged our orbit, if you see what I mean. Then we opened up the port, drew the few tools we had, Anthea said 'Do I just turn it all over with the fork?' I said 'I'll take back these brambles.'",0
"I knelt in the dirt. I said 'Mind these buds, if you see them.' 'What are they?' 'I think they mean to be crocuses.' 'Cool. Okay. Look, there's more over here. I'll use my hands when I get to them.' 'You can see that one's got a little purple in the middle there. See?' Her hair fell out from behind an ear and hung heavily, swinging. She was looking at the bud so intently she seemed almost cross-eyed, like she was fascinated by it, like she was figuring out how it works, the cogs and wheels inside. 'Yes.'",0
"he could tell I was watching, and she stood the fork in the ground and walked her long-legged walk, bowed and robotic, to fetch her drink. As she poured it down she stood like she stood at the window again, pale fingered, her hips forward, the line of her leg. 'Am I doing it right?' she said, then I showed her what I was doing and the dirt I'd cleared. 'See how dark this bit is compared to that.' Then we watched the kites over the field and the chimney on the house over the road oozing smoke.",0
"Exactly! I like what you said in the end, because as I was reading your comment I was thinking to myself: even conversations that don't have words included can be very meaningful.

"There is no law requiring you to perform oral sex. There is no rule stating what is and isn’t required during a private act between two consenting adults. But if you are the kind of person who just takes it completely off the menu from the get-go because, I don’t know, penises are ugly and/or vaginas are scary and cavernous, you can’t expect it back. Foreplay is a give-and-take kind of thing, and it requires of people the ability to do things strictly for the joy of pleasing someone else. Like, no, you are not likely to get any direct stimulation yourself while performing cunnilingus — you’re supposed to get your jollies from the act of giving.

His racism is a bonus. I used to work with men who I'm sure love Trump. If he gets in they can feel validated for their pawing over women's bodies, molesting or even raping them, being porn addicts, treating women like dogs and trashing them, and generally degrading women like Trump does. Women should be very afraid for their rights if Trump gets in and the GOP retains control of Congress.

How about real hate crimes? like the constantly escalating anti semitic crimes committed by Muslims living in the west  (particularly Europe) on our long established Jewish communities? Yeah , don't want to talk about that. Jews are fleeing Europe in numbers not seen since the Nazis! But Islam liked the idea of the final solution huh?

I feel like Trump answers the questions I've been asking for a long time, I don't need a bunch of political jargon just straight talk and thats what Trump offers. Why is this guy even being interviewed? He has nothing to do with anything. Go spend some money and shut your trap about our country unless you support the truth. Quit trying to brain wash the people who can't see between the lines/lies, You and all of your cronies will still be billionaires after Trump wins you don't need all the money. I for one am getting a kick seeing the media and all the left wing, crooked fuckers who have been making billions destroying our country squirm and do whatever they can to stop Trump from exposing the truth. Shame on all of you. Lets make America Great Again, TRUMP...........?",2
"+George Martin  Donald Trump does talk like a simpleton. Of the 200 words in his vocabulary, he uses 5 or 6 constantly. That doesn't sound like someone with profound language skills, but rather like someone lacking same skills. Trump keeps ""guaranteeing"" and ""promising"", but he's a bit short on delivering ANYTHING. When asked about specifics, he changes the subject. You've got yourself a real dilly here. Your vote will sure make a difference... Romney was pretty pathetic, as was McCain (I assume you voted for both of those empty shirts?) I guess Republicans just don't have anyone worth their salt anymore. Only idiots, Jesus Freaks and assholes....and then there's Trump, who wants to be all 3 wrapped into one (or at least he GUARANTEES it!) - Trump loves his Bible about as much as he loves his supporters. Once this Dog & Pony Show is over, he'll have only his ill-gotten MONEY to keep him happy, because the general public will finally be done with that ass clown!?",2
"I left my girl back home, I don't love her no more. And she'll never fucking know that, these fucking eyes that I'm staring at. Let me see that ass, look at all this cash. And I emptied out my cards too, now I'm fucking leaning on that. Bring your love baby I could bring my shame. Bring the drugs baby I could bring my pain. Bring the cups baby I could bring the drink. Bring your body baby I could bring you fame. And that's my motherfucking words too, just let me motherfucking love you.",1
"Seventeen shots, no 38. I’m like yeah, she’s fine, wonder when she’ll be mine. She walk past I press rewind to see that ass one more time and I got this sewed up. Tell me what you see, is it money or it's me? I smoke twenty, smell the weed I got hunnies in my V. They like, Monty, can you be my baby daddy, I'm like, yeah. I got robins on my jeans, you see the wings on every pair. All you see is Remy Boyz, you know my niggas everywhere. And if somebody got a problem, we could meet up anywhere. Now go say some, Don't you niggas play dumb, you know where we came from.",1
"Rummage through the shit, and try to salvage something to see if you can save any of it,",1
"Punk but none of it's fucking with me. Prick, you really feeling that bullshit? You think you killing them syllables. Quit playing. These beats ain't nothing to fool with. They call me Fire Marshall. I shut the shit down. Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round. I am also the opposite of what you are like. You are microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic. I am awesome and you are just awe struck. She's love stricken. She's got her jaw stuck, from sucking my dick. Aww Fuck.",1
"I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I made. Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed. But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you. No more pain bitch you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it straight into the planet. Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit. And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me, so you better hear me out, this much you owe me. I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while I've stayed faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid.",1
"Treat em like you don't need them and they ain't worthy of you. Feed em the same shit that you made me eat. All I ever felt was this helplessness. Imprisoned by a selfish bitch. Fuck you, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch. And it's just too late for the other side.",1
"Aside from how ridiculous Miley was, who the fuck was that blonde moron who introduced her? That was even more uncomfortable than the actual performance.? Miley made a total ass of herself?, there is nothing sexy about this sad little girl. Miley cyrus is god, fuck haters they’re just jealous of her lol?. Miley's singing is so bad, the devil inside her was like ""SCREW THIS SHIT I’M OUT!""? Seriously this gave me life! Rihanna shows her nipples and it's okay but Miley does this and it's not? Y'all need fucking help.",1
"And why does she keep grabbing her crotch? She was so cute when she had long brown hair, now she looks like a hooker. Very unoriginal and trashy and desperate. And please please explain to me what's up with her sticking out her snail tongue!? And why is she trying to have sex with robin thicke on stage!? What The hell Miley did u fall on your head cause hun u acting like a hoe?. I saw the boner!!! and after wards his walking to her to get more lolllll?.",1
"Miley rocks. Fuck all you homos that live in your mother's basements.? She is a dumb ass fuck and she is on drugs!! I bet you are some man hoe that likes this because you are a rapist. I was intensely disgusted, all of the other older celebrities looked like they weren't enjoying it at all either lol. Miley just needs to control her attitude on stage, I mean seriously bruh keep it professional am i right? Why would anyone be jealous of someone who behaves and looks like a cheap hooker?? You know it's stuff like this that really fucks up your emotions. Miley has been a staple for kids everywhere since Hannah Montana and was especially popular amongst young girls, and then years later from her alter ego, she decides to go down a road of controversy and straight up whore/slut activities. I can't even begin to grasp what her longtime fans have thought about this, but as for me, I'm like no more of this fucking madness.?",1
"I can't see how billy-ray cyrus is proud of his girl constantly acting like a stripper in front of millions, plus totally nude doing perverted shit on the cover of magazines. He and his family were supposed 2 be like old fashioned southern Baptists, Christians too… I'd be ashamed if my ""little girl"" did such trashy stuff, but he came out and said he was proud of her and to keep it up… wow, damn! What a fucking disgrace. She is one ugly alienesque weirdo. She walks like her legs are elastic bands, I’ve seen red light hookers with a lot more grace. And him, what a tit. The white race is a disgrace, sadly.? The quality of this video is SHITTY as hell. Whoever uploaded this, it's like he filmed it off his/her TV screen..c'mon man, u can do better than that!?",1
"She was all drugged up! She really thought she was gettin it!? They are both just stupid. We should boycott this shit and start listening to real music again. Jesus Fucking Christ ... Imagine the heights of amazingness it would be to fuck that girl's ass, right up the pooper!!!  I need to call my GF, like, right now!!? That flat ass should not be wearing that ... I have more ass then her. She's such a bad rolemodel .. I wouldn't be suprised if she does what washed up Lindsey Lohan did and appear in Playboy once nobody cares about her anymore. Also have a sex tape out and not a fake one that somebody made up.. ?",2
